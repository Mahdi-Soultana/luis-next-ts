          Iâ€™m a visual designer from Germany I had the chance to work for top
          brands and small beautiful ones. I believe good design is first of all
          about emotions and feelings and then your hard and technical skills.

          When you achieve a sense of new, or different, exactly at this moment
          you communicating and connecting with people on an emotional level.
          Now that's good design.
